<b>OOP PROJECT</b> <br>
<b>Scenario: </b> <br>
<i>You have been hired to create software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced.
Without the software, workers on the production floor are physically producing items and having to write down what is produced in a production log book.
Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generage production reports.</i>
<br><br><b>What is the project?</b> <br>
This assignment represents the integrated use of Object Oriented programming incorporated with elements of front-end design, as well as the integration of an SQL database. The program was created by me with minor collaboration between the professor, as well as several other student assistance. <br> <br>
The project began development in middle August, and spanned the entirety of the Fall 2020 semester at Florida Gulf Coast University. As of writing this program, my exposure to OOP languages is middle ground, as I understand concepts within the framework of OOP. <br><br>
<b>Purpose:</b><br>
I created this program to show competency in my ability to program, and will continue to add functionality to the program after the class has ended. The program reflects my programming ability, and will serve as a benchmark as my skills improve.
<br><br>This program was created in COP3003 - Object Oriented Programming at Florida Gulf Coast University.
